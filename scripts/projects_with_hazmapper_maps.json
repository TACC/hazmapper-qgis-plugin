Traditionally, post-disaster damage assessment activities focus on one hazard and overlook the potentially destructive cascading effects of multiple hazards on structures and infrastructure. This project provides data resulting from field reconnaissance emphasizing multi-hazard effects and interactions. The data set includes geotagged pictures, Lidar scans, 360 degree videos and images, UAS videos and images from a first wave of field investigation. Infrastructure surveyed includes port facilities, buildings (particularly historical structures), and bridge infrastructure. This data can be used to understand how the impacts of Hurricane Maria, along with infrastructure aging and delayed recovery or repair activities, may have influenced the damage level and failure modes observed during the earthquake sequence."

Both fires ignited near the wildland-urban interface and spread quickly because of the heavy winds and low humidity, ultimately developing into two of the most devastating conflagrations in California history. The fires caused the deaths of 30 people and combustion of 16,251 structures. \nThis dataset was gathered during extensive reconnaissance efforts that started shortly after the fires were contained and field teams could be deployed, and is documented in a GEEER report (Akin et al. 2025) accessible through the following URL: https://doi.org/10.18118/G6X37N. The dataset currently consists of photos, track logs, and shapefiles representing drone flight coverage areas. The dataset will likely be amended in the future to include LiDAR point clouds, shapefiles representing aerial LiDAR flight paths, and observations of any future land movements.\nThe data presented in this report will support future studies of infrastructure system performance and research aimed at developing improved post-wildfire hydrology and sediment movement models. As such, these efforts follow in GEER\u2019s long tradition of turning disaster into knowledge. \n"
